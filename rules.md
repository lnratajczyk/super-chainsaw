# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
First, we will ask if anyone has a part of the program that they want to work on, then random assignment for the other tasks.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will send updates on our progress in our group chat.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If any of us are having issues, we will ask questions in the group chat.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will check in with each other in the group chat to see how each of us are progressing. If someone really can't figure out their part, then the other members of the group will try to help. If noone can figure it out, then the person assigned goes to office hours.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
We will communicate well and have common sense.
